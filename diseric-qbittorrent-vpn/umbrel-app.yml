description: >-
  qBittorrent is a free and open-source BitTorrent client.
  This package automatically routes all of qBittorrent's traffic through a
  built-in VPN client powered by Gluetun. This enhances your privacy and
  security by hiding your IP address.
  You must configure your VPN provider in the settings before starting the app.
  Supports many providers like PIA, NordVPN, Mullvad, and more.
